# book-recommendation


The theme of our project was the construction of a book recommendation system. The end result is a simple server that allows you to query the API with a request for access to the recommendations of books that provide book or user input from the database.

The data needed to implement the project were downloaded from the Goodreads database : https://sites.google.com/eng.ucsd.edu/ucsdbookgraph/home

The following files were used in the project:
- goodreads_books.json.gz
- goodreads_interactions.csv
- goodreads_book_genres_initial.json.gz
- goodreads_book_genres_initial.json.gz
- goodreads_book_series.initial.json.gz
